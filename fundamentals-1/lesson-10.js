// Lesson 10 - Values and Variables 

/* 
  NOTE: 
  -----
# Variable names can't start with numbers
# Variable names can only use underscores and dollar signs (symbols)
# To use new / function variables, use _ or $ before hand ($function)
# Variable names should not start with capital letters
# Variables all in uppercase are saved for those that'll never change, e.g. PI
# Use good names for variables, myFirstJob/myCurrentJob over job1/job2
